# Inflation Calculator for Morocco

## Introduction

This project is a simple inflation calculator that uses historical data of inflation rates in Morocco. The goal of this project is to provide a tool that allows users to understand the impact of inflation on the value of money over time.

## Features

- The user can input an amount of money and a year.
- The calculator will show how much that money would be worth in today's Moroccan Dirhams, adjusted for inflation.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script and follow the prompts in the console.
3. Input the amount of money and the year you want to adjust from.
4. The script will output the equivalent value in today's Moroccan Dirhams.

## Data Source

The inflation rates used in this project are based on historical data of inflation rates in Morocco.

## Future Work

This is a basic implementation of an inflation calculator. Future work could involve adding more features, such as:

- Allowing the user to adjust money values between any two years, not just from a past year to the present.
- Expanding the calculator to include inflation data from other countries.

The goal of this project is to make economics more accessible and understandable through programming. Contributions are welcome!
